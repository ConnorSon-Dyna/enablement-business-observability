## Business Event Capture - Logs

This lab will utilize logs lines ingested by the OneAgent.  The log lines will be converted to business events for the `Fraud Check` step for the Astroshop `Order to Shipped` business process.

* Use `OpenPipeline` to convert incoming logs to business events
* Validate the data using a Notebook

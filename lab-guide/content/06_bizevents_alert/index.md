## Business Events - Alert

Real-time business metric alerting in Dynatrace is crucial for proactive issue identification, rapid response, and optimized business outcomes by enabling businesses to monitor and react to performance issues impacting key business processes and user experience before they escalate. 

By proactively addressing performance issues and optimizing business processes, Dynatrace helps organizations achieve better business outcomes, such as increased revenue, higher conversion rates, and improved customer satisfaction. 

This lab will we will use the `Place Order` business events `Revenue` data to create an alert when `Orders` have revenue = 0.   

This is an example scenario for this lab, but synchronization failures can happen and Dynatrace can provide immediate alerting notification when they occur.

Examples of where this could occur:

* Manual Data Entry
* Different Coding Systems
* Bidirectional Syncing

## Business Events - Alerts

Business event metric extraction is a convenient way to create your own business metrics. It enables you to:

* Create custom alerts, such as when a certain value surges or drops. Alerts can be based on attribute values or specific business event occurrences.
* Reduce your DDU consumption and lower your costs.

This lab will we will use the `Place Order` Business Events Revenue data to create an alert for data  using Business Events that have revenue = 0.   This is example scenario for this lab,  but synchronization failures do happen where Business Events and Davis Events could help provide your cusotomers immediate notification.

Examples of where this could occur:

* Manual Data Entry
* Different Coding Systems
* Bidirectional Syncing

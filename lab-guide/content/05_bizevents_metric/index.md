## Business Events - Metrics

Business event metric extraction is a convenient way to create your own business metrics. 

It enables you to:

* Create Dashboards and Notebooks for real-time monitoring and historical data analysis 
* Create custom alerts, such as when a certain value surges or drops. Alerts can be based on attribute values or specific business event occurrences
* Reduce your DDU consumption and lower your costs

This lab will utilize Dynatrace OpenPipeline to convert business events for the `Place Order` step of the Astroshop `Order to Shipped` business process to a Business Event metric.

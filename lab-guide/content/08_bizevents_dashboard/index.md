## Dashboards

Supporting customers to order from you and then delivering those products involves not just many of your own systems but also 3rd parties as well. This can make it difficult to understand, for a given customer, just where in this complex process is their order stuck/lost and can be very costly to then either manually retrieve orders or pay compensation to customers.

This particular view is designed to give an end-to-end view of order health, in real-time. The indicators along the top show the health and security of the underlying IT systems, and the Business KPIs can help track metrics which a Business stakeholder would care about.

In this example, we can track things like "Probable lost orders" which haven't progressed through this journey, as well as the financial impact of "Vouchers offered" - where we've felt obliged to offer a discount when people have had issues with orders getting stuck shipping etc.

This view is available, live, in the Playground environment for both internal and customer viewing:

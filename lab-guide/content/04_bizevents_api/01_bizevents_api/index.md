## Order Shipped

You can configure external business or IT systems to send business events to Dynatrace via API. 

In this section of the lab we will use a Dynatrace Workflow to send simulated event data to the Business Events API for the `Order Shipped` step of the Astroshop `Order to Shipped` business process.  

The Business Event API supports JSON, CloudEvents and CloudEvents batch payload formats.  The Business Events API supports Dynatrace `Access token` or `OAuth` authentication.
